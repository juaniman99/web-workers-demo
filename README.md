# web-workers-demo

I create this very simple web application to demostrate how to use the web workers to distribute heavy load in the background.

## Requirements

To make use of the workers, the site must be running on an http server. This means that if you simply open the index.html file it will not work.
But do not worry! I have prepared the project for you so that using **npm run start** you can easily start a server and play with this.
